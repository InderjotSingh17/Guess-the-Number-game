Guess the Number Game - Django Project
Welcome to the Guess the Number Game built with Django! This is a simple, interactive web game where users have to guess a random number between 1 and 100. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. Once the user guesses the number correctly, they are congratulated and the game resets.

🚀 Features
Random Number Generation: A random number between 1 and 100 is generated at the start of each game.

User Feedback: Users get immediate feedback, such as "Too high!" or "Too low!" to help guide their next guess.

Guess Attempts: The game tracks how many attempts the user has made and displays this information after a correct guess.

Dark Mode: The game includes an optional dark mode for a better gaming experience.

Game Reset: Users can easily reset the game and start over with a new random number.

🛠 Tech Stack
Backend: Django (Python)

Frontend: HTML, CSS (Bootstrap)

Session Management: Django sessions to track game state (number and attempts)
